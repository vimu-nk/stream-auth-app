## [0.3.3] 2025-04-29

### Features

-   Assigned a **unique 7-digit ID** to each user at registration (`uniqueId`)
-   Saved the ID in MongoDB and session object
-   Personalized dashboard greeting using the user's `firstName`
-   Displayed the user's unique ID on the dashboard

### Technical Improvements

-   Extended `next-auth` session and user types using `next-auth.d.ts`
-   Injected `firstName` and `uniqueId` into JWT and session callbacks
-   Resolved runtime bug: `Unexpected token '<'` caused by failed fetch to non-existent API
-   Fixed TypeScript errors with strict type definitions for session

### Result

-   Each user now has a distinct system identity (`uniqueId`)
-   Sessions are type-safe and include user-specific metadata
-   Improved stability and developer confidence with cleaner typing

## [0.4.0] 2025-05-01

### Added

-   NIC verification using Google Vision API (PDF417 scanning removed)
-   Upload both front and back of NIC
-   Extract 12-digit NIC number and compare with user-provided NIC
-   Autofill gender and birthday based on NIC structure
-   Full mismatch flow with manual NIC correction
-   Separate endpoint `/api/user/update-nic` for manual override
-   Auto-upgrade verification level to 2 on match
-   Hide verification panel if verified
-   Display userâ€™s verification level next to unique ID on dashboard

### Fixed

-   Session payload now correctly includes `verificationLevel`, `uniqueId`, `firstName`
-   TypeScript declaration for extended session via `next-auth.d.ts`
-   Session refresh issue fixed with `window.location.reload()` workaround after verification

### Removed

-   All references to `orgNIC`, `orgBday`, `orgGender`, and `orgAddress`
-   Removed `fullName` from schema and session

### Notes

-   Google Vision API is used to OCR English-only data

-   Auto re-login after successful NIC verification using saved credentials.

### Fixed

-   Avoided React error from calling `setState()` during render in `LoginPage`
-   Wrapped `ClientProviders` inside `AuthCredentialProvider` in layout to ensure context availability across app

### Improved

### Fixed
